\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}
In this phase of the project, we built a clear understanding of the problems writers face and designed a complete solution to address them. We explored existing tools, identified their limitations, and defined how CoWriteIA can offer a more helpful and consistent writing experience. All major requirements, system modules, diagrams, and architectural decisions were finalized, giving a strong foundation for development.

We also completed the initial implementations of the core system components such as project indexing, semantic memory, and the basic writing assistant. Overall, FYP-I helped us shape the direction of CoWriteIA and prepare the groundwork needed for building an intelligent, context-aware writing platform.

\section{Future Work}
In the next phase, we will focus on completing the remaining features and integrating all modules into a fully functional system. This includes improving the context-aware writing agent, completing dialogue generation and character management, and enhancing the gap analysis module. We will also work on research integration, better semantic search performance, UI/UX refinement, and overall system testing.

By the end of the next phase, our goal is to deliver a polished and reliable AI writing assistant that supports writers throughout their creative process.
