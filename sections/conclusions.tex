\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}
The first phase of this project focused on understanding the core challenges faced by long-form writers and designing a system capable of addressing those limitations. Through an analysis of existing tools and their gaps, we identified the need for a context-aware, memory-driven writing assistant. Based on these insights, we finalized the complete system architecture, data models, modules, and design decisions required for CoWriteIA.

During FYP-I, we also implemented the foundational components of the system, including project indexing, semantic memory, and the initial version of the writing assistant. This phase successfully established the technical direction and groundwork necessary for building a fully functional, intelligent writing platform in the next development stage.

\section{Future Work}
The next phase will focus on completing and integrating all remaining modules into a cohesive system. Key areas include enhancing the context-aware writing agent, completing dialogue generation and character management features, and improving the gap analysis module. Additional work will involve research integration, optimizing semantic search performance, refining the user interface, and conducting extensive testing across all modules.

By the end of the next phase, the goal is to deliver a robust, polished, and reliable AI-assisted writing platform that supports writers throughout their creative workflow.
